**Abstract:**\
This paper addresses performance degradation in database transaction management caused by high retry counts under fixed timeout strategies in Snapshot Isolation. It examines how predefined timeout values fail to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to premature transaction aborts, excessive retries, and reduced throughput in high-contention environments. The study emphasizes the role of dynamic timeout mechanisms that adjust waiting periods based on system state and transaction behavior to improve efficiency. By learning from prior executions and estimating appropriate completion windows, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary retries and lowers latency across varying node configurations. The paper highlights the need for adaptive, context-aware timeout management to enhance scalability and performance in concurrent database systems.

**Key Contributions:**
* **Retry Count Reduction:**\
Analyzed performance limitations of fixed timeout strategies in Snapshot Isolation that lead to excessive transaction retries under high contention.

* **Adaptive Timeout Management:**\
Designed and evaluated dynamic timeout mechanisms that adjust waiting periods based on workload conditions and transaction behavior.
  
* **Performance Evaluation:** \
  Compared fixed and dynamic timeout approaches across multiple node configurations, demonstrating reduced retry counts, lower latency, and improved throughput.
  
* **Research Leadership:**\
  Led the study and implementation focusing on improving transaction efficiency and scalability through intelligent timeout control in concurrent database systems.

**Relevance & Real-World Impact**
* **Improved Transaction Throughput:**\
Enhanced system efficiency by minimizing unnecessary retries and premature aborts in Snapshot Isolation–based database systems.

* **Scalable Concurrency Handling:**\
Enabled better adaptation to dynamic workloads and contention levels through context-aware timeout management.
